# STRONG - Strain Resolution ON Graphs

## Overview

STRONG resolves strains on assembly graphs by resolving variants on core COGs using co-occurrence across multiple samples.

In this tutorial we will run the complete STRONG pipeline on a small AD time series. To 
begin we need to set-up our config file. This has been **mostly** prepared for you but will require a small amount of editing. 

## Getting started

Create a VM - EBAME-Quince preferably 8 cores xlarge and login with ssh using X-windows forwarding.

Then we activate the STRONG conda

```
conda activate STRONG_db1
```

## Coassembly

Start off by moving into the /mnt directory create new directory Projects (if not already there) and subdirectory STRONG_AD:

```
cd ~/data/mydatalocal

mkdir Projects

cd Projects

mkdir STRONG_AD

cd STRONG_AD

```

Then copy in the short reads:

```

wget https://ebame6.s3.climb.ac.uk/data_small.tar.gz

cp /some/path/Tutorial/data_small.tar.gz .

tar -xvzf data_small.tar.gz


```
Have a look at the data folder structure:

```
ls data
```

<details><summary>Can you count the number of reads in sample1?</summary>


<p>

```
echo $(cat data/sample1sample1/sample1_R1.fastq |wc -l)/4|bc
```

</p>
</details>


Now copy in the STRONG config file:

```
cp ~/repos/Ebame21-Quince/configs/config.yaml .
```

Add this command to the `bayespaths` subsection if not present using your favourite 
command line text editor:

```
optional_args: '--nofilter'
```

Minimise that pesky prompt!
```
PS1='\u:\W\$ ' 
```

We will begin by performing the SPADEs coassembly. First good practice is to check what would be run if command issued:

```
STRONG --config config.yaml Results assembly --threads 8 --dryrun --verbose
```

Will run over 150 processes! STRONG is a complex pipeline.


Then run coassembly for real:

```
STRONG --config config.yaml Results assembly --threads 8 --verbose
```

This should take about twenty minutes. When it does done we can have a look at the coassembly outputs. The actual contigs are here:

```
./Results/assembly/spades/contigs.fasta
```

How good was the coassembly, what was the N50?


```
~/repos/Ebame21-Quince/scripts/contig-stats.pl < ./Results/assembly/spades/contigs.fasta
```

sequence #: 1966	total length: 6377796	max length: 174676	N50: 28942	N90: 3000

Other useful things to look at include the simplified graph that will be used for strain resolution. If you have enough memory on your local computer this can be visuaised with Ryan Wick's excellent [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage) program:


```
ls -l -h assembly/high_res/simplified.gfa
```

![Simplified](./Figures/Simplified.png) 

And the unitig per sample profiles, these are generated by thread threading reads onto the simplified graph, Sergey Nurk's application ***unitig-coverage*** does this:

```
tail assembly/high_res/simplified.mult_prof
```

This step of the pipeline also does bowtie2 mapping of reads onto contigs to get coverage 
profiles for binning:

```
head profile/split/coverage.tsv 
```

It also does the actual binning using as default a two step version of CONCOCT although metabat2 is an option:

```
more binning/concoct/list_mags.tsv
```

There should be three MAGs generated for the next steps in the analysis.

The next step is to extract out and simplify the SCG subgraphs for the actual bayespaths strain finding. We run this as above just change assembly to graphextraction:

```

cd ~/data/mydatalocal/Projects/STRONG_AD

STRONG --config config.yaml Results graphextraction --threads 8 --verbose
```

Can look at the results which are again in gfa format:

```
cd Results/subgraphs/bin_merged
```

Which are again in gfa format with coverages, the raw subgraph unitigs match to the original simplified gfa but the simplified do not:

Error in concoct_refine

original_data_matrix = original_data.values() -> tonumpy()
